## Running Unit & Integration tests
Run integration tests with `mvn clean -U install`.

## Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application locally. 
One way is to execute the main method in the `Application` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin like so:
`mvn spring-boot:run`.
